"""A webhook-mode plugin — the installable *manifest + webhook* shape.

Most third-party integrations should reach for THIS shape rather than the
in-process code plugin in ``../plugin.py``. A webhook plugin ships a declarative
manifest (``examples/webhook_manifest.yaml``) that tells Minder to expose an
inbound webhook path and pipe each POST into the vector store — nothing is
compiled into the platform and it installs at runtime. See ``examples/README.md``
for when to use which shape.

When the manifest's declarative ``store-vector`` mapping isn't enough — a payload
needs reshaping before it is stored — a plugin MAY add a small, reviewed
``handle_webhook`` handler (the ``webhook-ingest`` capability). This example is
that handler stub; it documents the request -> response contract:

  request  (Minder -> handler): the parsed JSON body of the inbound webhook, as a
           ``dict``. Minder verifies the shared secret named by the manifest's
           ``spec.trigger.webhook.secretRef`` *before* calling the handler.
  response (handler -> Minder): the record to store —
           ``{"text": <str>, "metadata": <dict>}`` — matching the manifest's
           ``spec.action.store.input`` shape. Return ``{}`` to acknowledge the
           delivery but store nothing (e.g. an event type you don't ingest).

Depends only on the SDK (stdlib): Minder owns the HTTP listener and secret
verification, so the plugin ships no web framework — it only shapes the payload.
